## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added
- Timestamp and content hash appended to trashed filenames for better tracking and deduplication
- Filename format in trash: `filename__YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_NNNNNNNNN__hash`
- MD5 hash calculation for file content (with SHA256 fallback)
- Directory hash calculation based on all contained files
- Nanosecond-precision timestamps to prevent filename collisions during rapid deletions

### Changed
- Trashed files now always include timestamp and hash suffix (previously only added on conflicts)
- Improved directory hash calculation with secure handling of special characters

### Security
- Use `find -print0`, `sort -z`, and `xargs -0 -r` to safely handle filenames with special characters
- Prevent filename injection attacks when calculating directory hashes

### Fixed
- Empty directory hash calculation now works correctly
- Special characters in filenames are handled safely during hash calculation
